//! Data structures and traits to be implemented by real-time clock / calendar devices.
//!
//! Prefer to use only the methods from the `DateTimeAccess` rather than the individual
//! methods from the `Rtcc` trait to avoid situations where the passing of time
//! makes the results of the method calls inconsistent if you combine the results
//! of several methods.
//!
//! For example, this can happen at certain timepoints:
//! 1. The time is `01:59:59`
//! 2. A call to `hours()` returns 1.
//! 3. The time is increased to `02:00:00`.
//! 4. A call to `minutes()` returns 0.
//! 5. A call to `seconds()` returns 0.
//! 6. Your system thinks it is `01:00:00`.
//!
//! The same applies to the date as well, as well as when calling setter methods.
